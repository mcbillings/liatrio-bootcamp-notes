Section 1.3.5 - Networking Basics
=================================

IP addresses are unique to each individual device on a network
-One device can have several IP addresses, but one IP address cannot have multiple devices attached to it

Hostnames are a way of identifying an IP address with a more human readable form-- such as google.com, which is later resolved into an actual IP address

Ports represent different connections a device can have at the same time
-Servers will usually only accept communication on specified ports
-Some known ports include: SSH: 22; HTTP: 80; HTTPS: 443

Subents refer to specific networks, denoted by the begining numbers of IP addresses

There are a few IP ranges that are reserved as private addresses, and will never be assigned as a public IP
-Examples include 10.0.0.0/8; 172.16.0.0/12; 192.168.0.0/16

Exercise

1. Subnet: 192.168.0.0/24
2. 255 available IPs
3. 192.168.0.65
4. It was either randomly assigned within the subnet or was manually assigned
5. 98.208.42.143
6. The router likely knows both my public and private ip, and knows where to direct packets when they're sent to my public ip based on my private ip
