===================

Vim has 4 modes--

Insert for adding text (What I'm using to type this now!)
Normal to move around and manipulate test
Visual for selecting blocks of text
Command for using commands

Normal Mode
--------------
-Accessed by pressing esc
-Can switch to insert mode using 'i'
-various keys traverse the text in various ways

-v entered visual mode and begins the selection at the cursor's position
-useful for managing large blocks of text at the same time
