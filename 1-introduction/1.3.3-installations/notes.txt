Section 1.3.3 - Installations
=============================

Different Linux distros use different package managers
--Since we're using Mac for the bootcamp, we use homebrew

You can search for different packages with each package manager
-Use "brew search" when using Homebrew

Once you know the name of the package you want to install, you can do so by using "brew cask install [package name]"

Occasionally, a package won't be available from the central yum/apt repository. In those cases, you can add the repository yourself using the following process:

1. Download repo key (wget, curl)
2. Update your package list
3. Install the package

You can check for updates using "brew update; brew outdated"

You can update packages using "brew upgrade"
